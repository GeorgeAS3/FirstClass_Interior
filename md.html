        <p class="right" style="font-weight: bold;">
            After reclaiming the Mishima Zaibatsu from his son and witnessing the power of the Devil firsthand in the second King of Iron Fist Tournament, CEO Heihachi Mishima began his own research into the terrifying power of the Devil Gene. Trying to replicate this superhuman strength, the Mishima Zaibatsu started a genetic modification plan with the goal of replicating the effects of the gene on regular humans through the creation of a synthetic Devil Gene. Heihachi used eggs from the assassin Nina Williams, who was cryogenically frozen by Dr. Bosconovitch at the Zaibatsu at the time, in order to create babies that he used to conduct these experiments. Most of the children died during this process and ultimately the supersoldier program was considered a failure.
            
            <br> <br> One of these children in the program was known as Subject NT01, or Steve Fox. A doctor superviding Steve's experimentation, Emma Kliesen, developed a bond with the boy, much to the disparagement of her more clinically minded colleagues. It was also Emma who helped Steve escape the laboratories at the age of 6 by faking his death in an experiment. 

            <br> <br> After this, Steve was most likely brought to an orphanage and was adopted by British parents, earning him his nationality later in life. It is unknown to what extent, if any, the experiments done in his childhood affected his physical capabilities, but what is known, is that 15 years later, Steve Fox would be known as one of the world's best middleweight boxing champions.

            <br> <br>  Steve himself, however, would end up remembering next to nothing about his past before his adoption.

            After an incident with The Syndicate, Steve entered the fourth tournament. He was the target of an assassination attempt by Nina Williams, but at the last minute she decided to aid him. He entered the fifth tournament to "settle the score" with the Mishima Zaibatsu.

                <p style="font-weight: bold;" onmouseover="hideinfoexceptmd3()" id="hide3">At first glance, Kazuya seems to be another archetypal fighting game hero protagonist, supported by his clothing of choice, simple white pants and red gloves and footpads, and his justifiable quest of taking revenge on his abusive father, Heihachi Mishima. However, Kazuya was in truth intended to be more villainous from the start, as his character profile in the first Tekken stated that his reason for entering the first King of Iron Fist Tournament was to exact revenge, and then use his father's vast fortune to carry out his plans for world domination. The Russian military even learned of these plans and entered the first Jack android into the tournament to stop him. Another clue indicating Kazuya's true intent and nature was his secret costume in the Playstation port of the first game, which turned out to be Devil.

        <div><h2 class="jumbotron text-center" onmouseover="hideinfoexceptmd4()" id="hide4">Hwoarang</h2></div>
            <div>
                <img src="https://www.fightersgeneration.com/np2/char1/br/hwoarang-br.jpeg" alt="Hwoarang" class ="image" style="width:200px;" onmouseover="hideinfoexceptmd5()" id="hide5">
                <p style="font-weight:bold" onmouseover="hideinfoexceptmd6()" id="hide6">Hwoarang is a hot-headed, impulsive person who enjoys fighting. He is sometimes arrogant and brash as he likes to boast about his skills and strength. He still holds his focus on his opponents to not lose himself in his pride. He is very rebellious and does not like to obey orders, but this changes in regard to his master, Baek, whom he dearly respects. Hwoarang tends to hold a grudge towards his enemies, and he has a strong sense of determination to fight his rivals, especially Jin Kazama.

                    Throughout the Scenario Campaign, most characters will chide Hwoarang for his impulsive behavior in persisting in a futile fight, while a few, such as Wang and Mokujin, offer a more optimistic view of his strong spirit despite his cause being doomed. Alisa later mentions her doubts about The Resistance's success as Hwoarang was more focused on his personal matter with Jin than actually saving the world.

                <img src="https://tekken254.co.ke/assets/img/characters/tk7/claudio.png" alt="Claudio" class ="image" style="width: 300px;" onmouseover="hideinfoexceptmd8()" id="hide8">
                <p style="font-weight: bold;" onmouseover="hideinfoexceptmd9()" id="hide9">Claudio is somewhat sarcastic and cocky, suggested by his intro quotes that see him calling his opponents either amateurs or an easy win, all while flicking his hair. One of his victory poses may suggest that he is friendly as he lends a hand to his opponent (after they lose against him) in a manner similar to Alisa. However, he is also shown to slow clap sarcastically. In both his and Xiaoyu's ending, Claudio shows his sinister side towards his main targets, particularly Devil Gene users such as Jin. After Heihachi exposes Kazuya in his devil form during his battle against Akuma, Claudio shows his disgust and becomes frustrated when the Mishima Zaibatsu dismisses the exorcists from their service.

                <p style="font-weight:bold;" onmouseover="hideinfoexceptmd12()" id="hide12">Nina's persona seems to be cold and indifferent. In fact, she had been drugged by an underground force when she was young in order to create the perfect assassin, regarding the chronology of Death by Degrees. The only man she had ever trusted was her father, who died shortly before Tekken 2. Ironically, after her father's death, Nina was controlled by Ogre, and was thus unable to feel any emotion.

                    Nina's personality remains monotonous yet sadistic when it comes to teasing Anna. Nina's win poses range from tomboyish and masculine to flirtatious, usually by placing a foot on top of the opponents body or showing off her body figure. Although she is an assassin, most of her missions are inclined for the good of the world, though she was hired to kill Steve by the syndicate during Tekken 4 and also assisted Jin when he started a world war during Tekken 6.

                    Lili has all the classic characteristics of a excessively spoiled girl. The only child of a wealthy oil industrialist, Lili seems to have always had a very comfortable life. She is also very mannered in her gestures during her cutscenes. Her bourgeois side being highlighted when she announces it is time for her afternoon tea, a habit that was very widespread among the aristocracy. This habit is also shown in one of her intros in Tekken 7 where she is having tea before the fight.
                    
                    Behind her bourgeoisie image, Lili is passionate about fighting, which had emerged since she fought the men who had kidnapped her. She goes as far to travel the world in search of opponents. She has a certain confidence in her fighting abilities - as shown by her winning and pre-match quotes - even though she lacks formal training in any personal combat style. Her father, who loathes violence in any form, refused to let her attend the local Savate studio. Therefore, Lili had to settle for ballet and gymnastics, both of which figure prominently in her brawling style.</p>
