        <img src="https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/tekken/thumb/Jin_Kazama.jpg/280px-Jin_Kazama.jpg" class="left" alt="Person" style="width: 300px;">

        <p class="right" style="font-weight: bold;">
            Jin Kazama is the son of Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima. Jun's intimate relationship with Kazuya grew and she became pregnant with Jin. The devil, that fled Kazuya when he was thrown into a volcano by his father, attempted to enter Jin while he was still in his mother's womb, but Jun managed to fight it off. Afterwards, Jun moved to a remote location in the mountains on her home island of Yakushima, where she raised Jin and trained him in the Kazama family's self-defense fighting style.
            
            <br> <br> Several years later, Jun sensed the approaching of a great evil and decided that it was about time she told Jin about his origins. She also told him that if anything were to happen to her, he should look for his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima. Jun's premonitions proved to be true, as she was attacked by Ogre four days later on Jin's 15th birthday. Hours after the chaos, Jin, who had fallen unconscious, awoke amongst the rubble with a devil brand on his arm. He began searching for his mother, with no success, and, enraged, Jin swore revenge. He was then taken in by Heihachi, who began to train him in Mishima-style Karate.

            <br> <br> Jin has worn a great deal of outfits during the course of the Tekken series. Most of his outfits feature a flame motif, and, with the exception of a single outfit in Tekken 6, gloves or gauntlets. In Tekken 6, Jin discards his gloves from Tekken 5 that contain the Kazama family crest in lieu of ones that model his former Mishima style ones. This could be a subtle hint at his personality change. [3] Jin sports his CEO outfit in Tekken 6 gameplay, with it being his default 2P outfit. He also has another outfit shown in the Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion opening, which is a black leather jacket, with white and red rider gloves, grey pants, and black shoes; he also wears a matching black sunglasses which were shown in a scene in the Scenario Campaign mode, and in Hwoarang's ending in Tekken Tag Tournament 2, in which he wears his CEO outfit during their motorcycle race.

            <br> <br> In Tekken 7, Jin sports a new zippered hoodie costume made of leather, with matching pants. He retains his trademark red gauntlets, which have now been extended to full-on armor, covering the entire length of his arms. He also wears a red belt and red boots.

                <img padding=100px src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ultimatepopculture/images/4/4e/Kazuya_Mishima_%28T7%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20190530133258" alt="Kazuya" class ="image">
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">At first glance, Kazuya seems to be another archetypal fighting game hero protagonist, supported by his clothing of choice, simple white pants and red gloves and footpads, and his justifiable quest of taking revenge on his abusive father, Heihachi Mishima. However, Kazuya was in truth intended to be more villainous from the start, as his character profile in the first Tekken stated that his reason for entering the first King of Iron Fist Tournament was to exact revenge, and then use his father's vast fortune to carry out his plans for world domination. The Russian military even learned of these plans and entered the first Jack android into the tournament to stop him. Another clue indicating Kazuya's true intent and nature was his secret costume in the Playstation port of the first game, which turned out to be Devil.

        <div><h2 class="jumbotron text-center">Hwoarang</h2></div>
            <div>
                <img src="https://www.fightersgeneration.com/np2/char1/br/hwoarang-br.jpeg" alt="Hwoarang" class ="image" style="width:200px;">
                <p style="font-weight:bold">Hwoarang is a hot-headed, impulsive person who enjoys fighting. He is sometimes arrogant and brash as he likes to boast about his skills and strength. He still holds his focus on his opponents to not lose himself in his pride. He is very rebellious and does not like to obey orders, but this changes in regard to his master, Baek, whom he dearly respects. Hwoarang tends to hold a grudge towards his enemies, and he has a strong sense of determination to fight his rivals, especially Jin Kazama.

                    Throughout the Scenario Campaign, most characters will chide Hwoarang for his impulsive behavior in persisting in a futile fight, while a few, such as Wang and Mokujin, offer a more optimistic view of his strong spirit despite his cause being doomed. Alisa later mentions her doubts about The Resistance's success as Hwoarang was more focused on his personal matter with Jin than actually saving the world.

                <img src="https://tekken254.co.ke/assets/img/characters/tk7/claudio.png" alt="Claudio" class ="image" style="width: 300px;">
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Claudio is somewhat sarcastic and cocky, suggested by his intro quotes that see him calling his opponents either amateurs or an easy win, all while flicking his hair. One of his victory poses may suggest that he is friendly as he lends a hand to his opponent (after they lose against him) in a manner similar to Alisa. However, he is also shown to slow clap sarcastically. In both his and Xiaoyu's ending, Claudio shows his sinister side towards his main targets, particularly Devil Gene users such as Jin. After Heihachi exposes Kazuya in his devil form during his battle against Akuma, Claudio shows his disgust and becomes frustrated when the Mishima Zaibatsu dismisses the exorcists from their service.

            <div>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/98/Nina_Williams_%28T7%29.png" alt="Nina" class ="image" style="width: 200px;">
                <p style="font-weight:bold;">Nina's persona seems to be cold and indifferent. In fact, she had been drugged by an underground force when she was young in order to create the perfect assassin, regarding the chronology of Death by Degrees. The only man she had ever trusted was her father, who died shortly before Tekken 2. Ironically, after her father's death, Nina was controlled by Ogre, and was thus unable to feel any emotion.

                    Nina's personality remains monotonous yet sadistic when it comes to teasing Anna. Nina's win poses range from tomboyish and masculine to flirtatious, usually by placing a foot on top of the opponents body or showing off her body figure. Although she is an assassin, most of her missions are inclined for the good of the world, though she was hired to kill Steve by the syndicate during Tekken 4 and also assisted Jin when he started a world war during Tekken 6.

                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Personality
                    Lili has all the classic characteristics of a excessively spoiled girl. The only child of a wealthy oil industrialist, Lili seems to have always had a very comfortable life. She is also very mannered in her gestures during her cutscenes. Her bourgeois side being highlighted when she announces it is time for her afternoon tea, a habit that was very widespread among the aristocracy. This habit is also shown in one of her intros in Tekken 7 where she is having tea before the fight.
                    
                    Behind her bourgeoisie image, Lili is passionate about fighting, which had emerged since she fought the men who had kidnapped her. She goes as far to travel the world in search of opponents. She has a certain confidence in her fighting abilities - as shown by her winning and pre-match quotes - even though she lacks formal training in any personal combat style. Her father, who loathes violence in any form, refused to let her attend the local Savate studio. Therefore, Lili had to settle for ballet and gymnastics, both of which figure prominently in her brawling style.</p>
